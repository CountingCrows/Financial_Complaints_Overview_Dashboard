# Financial_Complaints_Overview_Dashboard

## Overview
I've created an interactive dashboard with Tableau Public for a Project named Financial Complaints Overview. The dataset used is Financial Consumer Complaints from [RWFD](https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data) where it contains data from 2011 to 2020. 

The Case of this project is that we want to know what components of Financial Complaints can impact the company. This can help us to gain various insights to then make decisions or recommendations for the customers.

- Total Complaints: Tracks the total complaints per month.
- Timely Responds: The Timely Response card displays the percentage or count of complaints that received a response within a specified timeframe.
- In Progress: This card highlights the number of complaints that are currently in progress or under investigation.
- Resolve at No Cost: The Resolve at No Cost card indicates the percentage or count of complaints that were resolved without any additional cost to the consumer.
- Complaints by Issue: The bar chart visually represents the distribution of complaints across different issues or categories.
- Complaints by State: The HexMap visually displays the geographical distribution of complaints by state.
- Complaints by Product: The bar chart categorizes complaints by product, providing insights into which products are generating the most feedback.
- Complaints by Media: This bar chart illustrates the distribution of complaints based on the media or communication channels through which they were submitted.
- % Consumer Disputed: The pie chart represents the percentage of complaints that are disputed by consumers.
